As one of the longest serving Presidential Innovation Fellows I have seen the program go through multiple iterations, bring in new classes, and change leadership twice. I’ve also seen the gaps in the program and in the alumni experience. Before PIF, outside of my work in technology/startups, I built successful alumni initiatives for the Fulbright program that exist and continue to scale to this day.

If elected, I would focus on two major areas, in-part building off the PIF Foundation 2017 survey: brand and alumni experience.

1. **Brand**. The US Digital Service and 18F, two amazing organizations in their own right, have become synonymous with government transformation. I think the PIF program occupies its own space and unique value proposition. Working with the PIF program team, I would partner with my fellow board members to launch a new initiative to elevate the PIF brand. This might look like a variety of things, but could be in the form of a podcast, a book, speaking opportunities,

2. **Alumni experience**. Alumni networks are strengthened by engaging and in-person experiences. If elected I would identify those needs and work with the board and the alumni community to plan new events. If budget is an issue, I would look to find new ways to increase our budget.

The PIF program changed my life. It would be my honor to serve the PIF Foundation, bring new ideas to the Foundation,  and partner with other board members to strengthen the community.

Justin has been a Presidential Innovation Fellow since January 2016. He worked on strengthening communities through affordable Internet access, precision medicine and healthcare, and building product leadership at the agency leadership level.

Alison is a veteran of three govtech programs. In 2013 she became a second-round PIF, subsequently co-founded 18F and later became Development Lead at the Commerce Data Service. Alison found her calling in civic tech, and as a PIFF board member, Alison hopes to help others realize the same mission, creating technology for the American people. As a board member, Alison's goals would include: achieving continuity of programs, such as the alumni weekend, as long-standing Board members complete their terms; help recruit a diverse slate of Fellows and welcome them to the community, especially through the PIF onboarding experience; and continue to develop the Speakers' Bureau, as it is so important to foster the spread of great ideas and innovation, get word out about the program, and to provide ongoing opportunities for alumni. In addition, Alison would like to propose a "phone-a-friend" program, for current PIFs to get advice from alumni who are amongst the few people who've been in their shoes. Alison's strengths are in listening, achieving consensus, being a force multiplier, and a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion. She would bring all of these, along with her deep history in govtech, to the PIFF board.

When I joined the US Government at the beginning of my career, the spirit of innovation was expressed almost always by individuals with an innovative mindset who also found themselves in a situation that tolerated, and perhaps rewarded, innovative problem solving.  In later years, position descriptions for managerial and senior executive level positions included requirements for being able to lead change, a meaningful advancement but one as often creating the inevitable search for examples at annual review time.  However, when I came back into government as a PIF-5, I saw a significant transformation had occurred.  Innovation DNA had moved from the individual in just the right circumstances to individual position descriptions and had now become a part of the organization.  

This is the world of PIF, infusing an increasingly willing government organization with fresh innovation DNA, if I can use that analogy.  PIF, along with its 18F and broader TTS siblings, has already broken new ground but will in the years to come, I believe, serve an even more transformational role in government as organizations learn more about innovative practices, embrace innovation at the institutional level and seek fresh perspectives continuously to use rapidly developing technologies and methodologies to transform government policies, products and services.  PIF will lead for the government in a space of particular interest to me, to build order out of chaos, to celebrate the art and science of design and solutions, and to anticipate and own the human consequences.  Our greatest purpose as a society is to create and to repair and improve the world at all times.  The PIF program reflects this vision.  

My interest in the PIF Foundation Board is to help bring about and recreate continuously this vision for PIF, to expand its transformational reach in government, yes to remain non-partisan but to bring a bottoms-up, civil society and public value first sense of ethos to its work and work consequences, even if the technologies and methodologies employed in its innovative and transformational activities are newly emerging and cutting edge.  I spent a career in government before spending another career in the private sector and then, finally, created a start-up, developed a new product and service line that had not existed before, shaped a market for it, and, perhaps most fun, made payroll for a team of employees, each of whom is on their own creative journey. Well, upon reflection, it turns out that maybe I had some of these same experiences even while in government and in dot com corporate positions, even before founding my own start-up company.  In my view this is, perhaps, the next step for PIF’s branding, to grow from digital transformation to methodological and technological innovation to embodying the spirit of entrepreneurship even within existing government organizations.  Serving on the Board of the PIF Foundation would allow me an opportunity to develop this vision with colleagues on the Board and among alumni, as well as in the PIF program.

Hello. I'm Henry, the doctor from Round 1.  Please do *not* vote for me.  I just wanted to say hi to everyone and exploit this process to share a quirky story from the inception of the Foundation.  I am likely to share this repeatedly every couple of years.

Back then, I was on the provisional Board, and we were figuring out how to randomly and fairly decide who would get the 1-year vs 2-year seats to begin the offset Board terms.  We didn’t want everyone being re-elected all at once, and I’m sure there’s some good justification for that somewhere.

At 7:10pm ET the night we were to decide, I wrote to Adam Riggs (R2) and Raph Majma (R1):  "Okay I'm going to head to the grocery store and buy five mega millions lottery tickets randomly generated, then I'll write the new board members names on each new one, one for each member. I'll photo this and send to you both. The two with the numbers closest to the winning lotto numbers tonight (highest number of exact matches but then if tie etc closest on the bonus ball to the actual winning bonus number) get the 2-year terms."  

So I drive to the Stop & Shop and, despite a broken machine, find someone to sell me the lottery tickets.

Midnight rolls through and, dang it, some people have tied!  ...and the tie breaker doesn't work either since *two* people got the same bonus ball!  What are the chances?  (Actually they were non-zero.)

I pen an extensive email to Raph and Adam and make sure the time stamp is clear also.   I'm going to fall back to the Oregon Pick 4 game, which completes later, and use that to break the tie based on the first number and non-overlapping ranges.  See, this way we have time-stamped external random-number-generator verifiability, something we could have solved with technology, but why do that when you can overly
complicate the procedure with naturally occurring state lottery results?

At 1 a.m., Adam Riggs emails me back: "Good Lord."

Later at 5:33 am I wake up and check the results and we have our first PIF Foundation Board seats assigned and offset properly so that not every seat is turning over at the same time.  

In the photo below you’ll see the original five: Ian, Ben, Sarah, James and Robert, and the lotto tickets and the subsequent state lotto tickets decided who got the longer terms and who got the shorter terms.
